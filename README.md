# HWS_QRscanner
QR scanner - personal project.

In this project I've used the following Swift frameworks:
- AVFoundation 
- CoreData
- WebKit

Features worth to mention:
- ScannerViewController verifies AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus. In case camera usage is denied, Alert Controller provides an option to open iPhone settings.
